    <p>I am a Lobotomy Corporation Manager with 12+ hours in Abnormality management. Tasked with managing a entire company filled with unknown and dangerous abnormailties, we aim to produce enkephalin, a form of energy that is shown to be quite potenant for our current energy demands and...wait...NO WAIT DON'T CLICK ON "DON'T TOUCH ME"!!!!

    <h2>Der Freischütz</h2>
    <h5>Der Freischütz's Bio, July 7, 2020</h5>
   <img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/2f/12/7YMDVKGx_o.png" alt="Der Freischütz" style="height:300px"/>
    <p>Der Freischütz is a HE humanoid abnormality that wears a large cloak and grey clothing. His color pallet of his cloak conists of black, yellow and blue colors. His body is a black wispy form with no disguishable features besides its eyes, head, arms and legs. It carries a large gun, most likely a musket or rifle, with it.</p>
    <p>Der Freischütz has a Qliphoth counter of 3, which can be lowered if a employee interacts with Der Freischütz with Justice lower than level 3, a medium chance with normal work result, and a high chance with a bad work result. The Qliphoth Counter will immediately reach 0 when doing a "Request/Commission." When the counter reaches 0 or doing a "Request/Commission", he will perform his ability, where he will fire a powerful bullet that flies across from the left screen to the right, dealing massive 80 Black Damage (Health and Sanity damage). This bullet is commandable via "Request/Commission" for up to 6 shots at a cost of 10 PE energy boxes of your total quota.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Der Freischütz's E.G.O Equipment</h2>
    <h5>Weapon's description, abilities, Tips and Warnings, July 8, 2020</h5>
    <img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/24/aa/HzEBDfXg_o.png" alt="E.G.O Weapon" style="height:500px"/>
    <p>Der Freischütz's E.G.O equipment consists of a "Magic Bullet"(40 PE Boxes), "Suit Magic Bullet"(45 PE Boxes), and E.G.O Gift "Magic Bullet", which has a 4% drop rate. The Magic Bullet weapon requires a employee with Temperance Level 3, and the Suit magic bullet also requires a Justice and Fortitude level 3, so start training your favorite employee as you can only produce one. It's gift, once granted, gives the employee +10 Movement and Attack speed at the cost of -5 Health and Sanity. Both the suit and gift give a Max and Min. Attack power +3 when the weapon from the same abnormality is equipped.</p>
    <p>When the employee is tasked to supress any abnormality, the employee will aim the weapon and fire a bullet. Similar to Der Freischütz's ability, the bullet will go across the hallway the employee is in, dealing 26-28 Black damage to anything in it's path due to it's very long range.

As such, it is highly advised that a employee equipped with Der Freischütz's E.G.O equipment should be sent alone for abnormality supression in order to avoid friendly fire and causing the First Trumpet to go off due to other employees panicking or dying.</p>
